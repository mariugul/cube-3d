## Introduction
<a name="Introduction"/>

This is an application for generating code for a LED cube. The application is capable of simulating the LED cube as well as generate the necessary code for programming the LED cube in either [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) or C with [Atmel Studio](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/avr-support/atmel-studio-7). Currently, this works for a 4x4x4 LED cube and will eventually include other sizes. The Arduino/Atmega328 code and details can be found in the [LED-Cube-Code](https://github.com/mariugul/LED-Cube-Code) repository.

## Installing
<a name="Installing"/>

Download the application (.exe) from [releases](https://github.com/mariugul/cube-3d/releases) and follow the install wizard. It works for Windows 10 and possibly earlier Windows OS'es (not tested).

## Usage
The application generates a pattern table for a 4x4x4 LED cube and makes it easy to visualize the patterns. The code for programming the LED cube comes with the application and does also exist in its own repository [LED-Cube-Code](https://github.com/mariugul/LED-Cube-Code). The application is depicted in the image below.
