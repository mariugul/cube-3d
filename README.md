## Introduction
<a name="Introduction"/>

This is an application for generating code for a LED cube. The application is capable of simulating the LED cube as well as generate the necessary code for programming the LED cube in either [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) or C with [Atmel Studio](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/avr-support/atmel-studio-7). Currently, this works for a 4x4x4 LED cube and will eventually include other sizes. The Arduino/Atmega328 code and details can be found in the [LED-Cube-Code](https://github.com/mariugul/LED-Cube-Code) repository.
